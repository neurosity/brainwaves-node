# Neurosity Brainwaves in Node ðŸ¤¯

Quickly get started streaming brainwave data in Node via the [notion-js](https://github.com/neurosity/notion-js) API.

```js
const { Notion } = require("@neurosity/notion");
const { email, password } = require("./auth");

(async function main() {
  const mind = new Notion();
  await mind.login({ email, password }).catch(console.error);

  // mind.brainwaves("psd")
  mind.brainwaves("raw").subscribe((brainwaves) => {
    console.log(brainwaves);
  });
})();
```

> ðŸ’¡ You'll need a [Neurosity account](https://console.neurosity.co).

## Getting started

Run in the terminal:

1. Clone this repo and run `npm install`
2. Turn on your Neurosity headset
3. Run the following command in the terminal:

```
node index.js --email=NEUROSITY_EMAIL --password=NEUROSITY_PASSWORD
```

Another way to provide credentials is to create a `.env` file on the root of the repo and add:

```
NEUROSITY_EMAIL=*******
NEUROSITY_PASSWORD=********
```

## Specify a Device ID (optional)

If you only have 1 Crown, you can skip this step.

With multiple Crowns, by default, the Neurosity SDK will select the oldest device on your account. If you wish to specify a device by id, you can do the following:

```
node index.js --email=NEUROSITY_EMAIL --password=NEUROSITY_PASSWORD --deviceId=NEUROSITY_DEVICE_ID
```

or add it to the `.env` file:

```
NEUROSITY_EMAIL=*******
NEUROSITY_PASSWORD=********
NEUROSITY_DEVICE_ID=********
```
